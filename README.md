# borrower
An Android-based "borrowing" app for checking items in and out of a "library", using QR codes.

As used in our creative community for tracking who has shared items https://www.facebook.com/KreakomunumoCommunity/

## TO USE
1. Print QR codes for items and users (you can do this here http://goqr.me/). The format is simple: u<username> for a user, or i<item> for an item.

For example: 
 * uAlice
 * uBob
 * iProjector
 * iDoor key
 * iTablet
 * iCordless Drill
 
2. Start the app and leave it running near where your "library" is.

## TO BORROW:
Click the "borrow" button, and then scan your username QR code, and then the QR code on the item you want to borrow.

## TO RETURN:
Click the "return" button, and then scan your username QR code, and then the QR code on the item you want to return.
